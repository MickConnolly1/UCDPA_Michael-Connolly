Gun Control Analysis in the USA.
This project is based on a small survey done on gun control in the USA 
it is comprised of 2 data sets that I found on kaggle.
the first data set looks a "gender" "age" "States"  "Regions" "political affiliation" and view on gun restrictions 
along with views on whether  stricter gun controls would reduce mass shootings. The second dataset was merged to this to get a wider 
View with data on mass killings and gun related violence based on "states" & " regions.
